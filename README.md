# Poster Latex Template
Create a poster with precise controls.

This is just a simple example and template to prepare a poster using Latex.
To use this template, you can either modify it locally or upload it to Overleaf.

Read the comments within the main.tex and try it out. You should be able to generate beautiful posters within a few minutes once you have the materials ready.

Please send email to me (climate at changliao dot us) if you have questions.
Thank you.
